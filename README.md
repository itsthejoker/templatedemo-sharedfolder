# Templates in a Common Folder

The point of this repo is to show how Django handles templates when you only have a single folder for them. All templates in this project are located in the top-level directory `templates` and can be edited from there.

### Pros

- Easy to keep track of templates
- Easy to find template to edit

### Cons

- have to specify exactly what template you're looking for -- e.g., `one/index.html`
